# Creating passwords

## Why do we need passwords

Passwords protect your accounts and websites ask you for them to make sure it is really you!

## What is stopping someone from knowing my password?

The only thing that can stop someone else from knowing your passwords online, and using your accounts for anything they want are the following good practices:

-   Creating unique, complicated passwords
-   Not sharing any details about your passwords with friends or family
-   Using different passwords on all accounts (write them on your phone or **use a password manager**)
